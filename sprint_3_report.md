## What's New (User Facing)
 * Modifying Itinerary Functionality 
 * Saving Itineraries to Database
 * Full implementation of program UI

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we successfully completed the development of the user interface (UI) and implemented two key backend functionalities: modifying itineraries and saving itineraries. To achieve these goals, we collaborated closely to ensure the backend database schema and API endpoints were properly aligned with the frontend design. While debugging and refining these features, we encountered some challenges related to handling user-specific data efficiently, which we resolved by iterating on our database queries. This sprint provided valuable insights into the importance of clear API design and the role of communication between team members in integrating components seamlessly.

## Unfinished Work
The task of connecting the backend and frontend remains incomplete. This was primarily due to time constraints, as a significant portion of the sprint was dedicated to debugging and perfecting the itinerary functionalities. Progress on this task has been documented, with notes outlining the steps required for completion, and it has been carried over to the next sprint for prioritization.
