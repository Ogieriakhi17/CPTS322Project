## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 1, our team focused on creating the foundational planning diagrams for the project, including component, deployment, and sequence diagrams. This helped solidify our understanding of the system's structure and core workflows, setting a clear direction for our development. Despite solid progress, we encountered some blockers. Debugging issues arose during the diagram creation, and we faced challenges in fully understanding certain aspects, especially in the deployment documentation.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
